            <p style="font-family:cursive, Times, serif"> For David Goggins, childhood was a nightmare - poverty,
                prejudice,
                and physical abuse colored his days and haunted his nights. But through self-discipline, mental
                toughness, and
                hard work, Goggins transformed himself from a depressed, overweight young man with no future into a U.S.
                Armed
                Forces icon and one of the world's top endurance athletes. The only man in history to complete elite
                training as
                a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force Tactical Air Controller, he went on to set records in numerous
                endurance
                events, inspiring Outside magazine to name him The Fittest (Real) Man in America. In Can't Hurt Me, he
                shares
                his astonishing life story and reveals that most of us tap into only 40% of our capabilities. Goggins
                calls this
                The 40% Rule, and his story illuminates a path that anyone can follow to push past pain, demolish fear,
                and
                reach their full potential.</p>

                One of
                the harbingers of success is understanding how nonverbal cues such as body language, dress and demeanor
                affect
                how you are perceived and understood. In this book Navarro, one of the leaders in nonverbal behaviors,
                demonstrates how to modify your subconscious statements to your greatest advantage and also read what
                other
                people are "saying" nonverbally. These skills will increase your ability to accurately assess moods,
                decode
                behaviors, anticipate problems, avoid hidden pitfalls, influence negotiations and understand the secret
                motivations of those around you.</p>

                lively
                book about the value of silence and solitude.It is to introverts—Rosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve
                Wozniak—that
                we owe many of the great contributions to society. In Quiet, Susan Cain argues that we dramatically
                undervalue
                introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout
                the
                twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to
                successful introverts—from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his
                talks, to a
                record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. </p>

                Transform your life with tiny changes in behaviour, starting now.

                People think that when you want to change your life, you need to think big. But world-renowned habits
                expert James Clear has discovered another way. He knows that real change comes from the compound effect
                of hundreds of small decisions: doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a
                single short phone call.

                He calls them atomic habits.
